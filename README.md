# Mall Customer Segmentation using KMeans

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **KMeans clustering** on the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers into groups based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection (Annual Income, Spending Score)
3. Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
4. KMeans clustering
5. Visualization of customer segments
6. Exporting clustered dataset

## 📊 Results
- **5 clusters** were identified.
- Example segments:
  - Cluster 1: High income – high spenders
  - Cluster 2: High income – low spenders
  - Cluster 3: Low income – high spenders
  - Cluster 4: Average income – average spenders
  - Cluster 5: Low income – low spenders

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
